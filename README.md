## Branch Naming Convention
> Note this is unconfirmed yet since our group should decide on the branch codes     

* Use words that summarise the purpose of the branch at the beginning of the branch name, e.g. **bug/module-searcher-component/query-parser, wip/NUSMods-parser, feature/core-mods-recommender**
* Use slashes to separate parts
* Delete branch when youâ€™re done with it
